            <p class="text">According to, The Nature Conservancy, iconic North American trees are already dying from pests and pathogens. On top of that, with cutting down trees, we are in some essense destroying nature. Impacts on wildlife, local economies, and forest's climate changes are only a few topics that are being affected by the loss of these trees. </p>

            <p class="text">Trees benefit us in ways more than one. Some instances we have never even thought deeply about. A research done by a scientist from The Nature Conservancy, has found that trees help boost our mental health while also raising our physical health. When we walk around trees, we are indeed walking very close the beautiful nature. </p>
